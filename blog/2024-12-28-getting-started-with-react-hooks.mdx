React Hooks revolutionized how we write components by enabling state and lifecycle features in functional components. Let's explore the most common hooks and their practical applications.

## Understanding useState

The useState hook is your gateway to state management in functional components. It provides a simple way to declare state variables and their update functions.

```javascript
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

### Common Use Cases

- Form input management
- Toggle states
- Counter implementations

## useEffect in Practice

The useEffect hook handles side effects in your components, making it perfect for:

- Data fetching
- Subscriptions
- DOM manipulations

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  document.title = `Count: ${count}`;
}, [count]);
```

## Custom Hooks

Learn how to create reusable logic with custom hooks:

- Extract common stateful logic
- Share behavior between components
- Keep your code DRY

### Example Custom Hook

```javascript
function useWindowSize() {
  const [size, setSize] = useState({
    width: window.innerWidth,
    height: window.innerHeight,
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    const handleResize = () => {
      setSize({
        width: window.innerWidth,
        height: window.innerHeight,
      });
    };

    window.addEventListener("resize", handleResize);
    return () => window.removeEventListener("resize", handleResize);
  }, []);

  return size;
}
```
