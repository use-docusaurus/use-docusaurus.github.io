# Commit Message Generation Custom Instructions

Please generate commit messages in the following format:

- Generate instruction for each file in changes
- Type: <type> (e.g., feat, fix, docs), Always include type, It's mandatory
- Short description: A concise summary of the change
- Body: Additional details if necessary, wrapped to 72 characters, add new line after short description

## Best Practices for Commit Messages

- Separate subject from body with a blank line
- Limit the subject line to 50 characters
- Capitalize the subject line
- Do not end the subject line with a period
- Use the imperative mood in the subject line
- Wrap the body at 72 characters
- Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
- Use present tense in the subject line (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.
- When fixing a bug, include the issue number in the commit message.
- Keep each commit focused on a single purpose; avoid mixing unrelated changes.
