# Intro

This documentation is an opiniated to customize Docusaurus's default installation. First install Docusaurus and then follow this documentation. I also call Docusaurus as Docu (so that I can type less). The very site you are reading is customized using this documentation.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new docusaurus site** using the classic template. You can follow official [Docusaurus documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs) to create a new site.

### How to follow this documentation

Ideally if all the changes could have been a plugin which you can install and configure, it would have been ideal. But the changes are wide-spread and moreover the recent trend of copy-pasting code seems to be giving more control to the developer. So, this documentation is a step-by-step guide to customize Docusaurus.

### Why did I do this?

Firstly, I was using Docusaurus heavily for creating multiple sites - for me and for clients. And later customizing it using Tailwind. And installing Tailwind itself is not straight forward in Docu. And also customizing can be done with CSS or Swizzling layouts.

I preferred to style as much as possible with CSS, and I will mention if anywhere Swizzling is required. I also wanted to have a single source of truth for all the customizations I did. So, I created this documentation.
